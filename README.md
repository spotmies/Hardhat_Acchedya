Solidity Code for Blockchain-based Verification System
This repository contains the Solidity code for the smart contracts used in the blockchain-based verification system. The smart contracts are responsible for securely storing and managing the verification status of users on the Polygon Matic network.

Contract Details
The following contracts are included in this repository:

Verification: This is the main contract that manages the verification status of users. It contains functions for adding, updating, and retrieving the verification status of users.
Getting Started
These instructions will help you get started with the Solidity code for the blockchain-based verification system.

Prerequisites
You will need the following software installed on your machine:

Truffle - Development environment for Ethereum-based smart contracts
Ganache - Personal blockchain for Ethereum development


Built With
Solidity - Contract-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.
Truffle - Development environment for Ethereum-based smart contracts.
Ganache - Personal blockchain for Ethereum development.




# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
